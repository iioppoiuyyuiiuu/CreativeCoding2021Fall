## Assignment for lecture 8
Color training game: in the 16 grids choose the grid that you think is closest to the right target color, to gradually approximate this color. Successful selection of the target color is considered a game victory.

At first, I planned to make this work because in the course of Modeling Foundation 2 last semester, I had difficulty in mixing colors with pigments without any painting foundation, so I wanted to develop a small game of color sense to help beginners get familiar with mixing colors through processing.

I chose to pick up the color of the mouse position when I wrote it, resulting in a cheat: click on the right circle to win the game. This would have been a mistake, but I think it is very much in line with the real world method of color blending: for those colors that can't be blended out, directly buy the corresponding pigment can solve the problem.
