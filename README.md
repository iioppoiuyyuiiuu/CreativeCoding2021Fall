##Assignment for lecture 3
###This is my first work in learning processing. I studied the Mondrian painting and tried to recreate it through code. To make it look more like a Mondrian painting, I defined a few rules, such as that there must be a large red square in the center of the image.
Then I used processing to imitate Wall Drawing #122 by Sol LeWitt. I think this work is fairly restored. But there is a small problem that the two arcs are not smooth at the junction. I tried to use a fitted sinusoid instead, but that didn't work.
